== 1.0.0 / 2008-03-26

* Change the pool command line script usage to make it simpler (I hope)
* Add a new report: final_four
* FIXME: Final four report assumes payouts go to 1st and 2nd and last places.
  This should be configurable.

* Bugfix the picker wrapper script.  Getting used to bones/rubyforge.

== 0.0.2 / 2008-03-23

* Changed the picker wrapper script to ruby because it seems that
  that is what rubyforge tools expect.
